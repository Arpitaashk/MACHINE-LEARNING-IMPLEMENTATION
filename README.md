""Description
This project focuses on the implementation of a machine learning model using the scikit-learn library to solve a real-world classification or prediction problem. As part of CodTech Internship Task-4, the primary objective is to build a predictive system that can analyze patterns in data and provide meaningful outcomes — such as spam email detection, sentiment analysis, or customer churn prediction.

The entire process is encapsulated in a Jupyter Notebook which includes:

Dataset loading and preprocessing

Model selection and training

Performance evaluation and visualization

Final predictions with insights

the notebook demonstrates a complete ML workflow suitable for beginner to intermediate-level practitioners aiming to understand supervised learning techniques.""

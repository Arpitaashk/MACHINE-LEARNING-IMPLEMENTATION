Machine Learning Implementation

This project demonstrates a basic implementation of machine learning using Python. It walks through all essential stages of a machine learning workflow—from data preprocessing and visualization to model training and evaluation.


Project Overview

The notebook in this repository performs classification using the **Iris dataset**, which is a widely used dataset in pattern recognition. The implementation showcases how to:

- Load and understand data
- Perform data visualization
- Split data into training and testing sets
- Train a machine learning model
- Evaluate and display the results


 Technologies Used

- **Python 3**
- **Jupyter Notebook**
- `pandas` – for data manipulation
- `matplotlib`, `seaborn` – for visualization
- `sklearn` (Scikit-learn) – for model building and evaluation
